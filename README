> The Geyser plugin thatâ€™s *not ready yet* â€” but worth the wait.

Yeah, we know.  
You probably came here expecting a full, working version of our high-speed Geyser plugin.  
**Itâ€™s not live â€” yet.** And thatâ€™s intentional.

Right now, weâ€™re deep in the **benchmarking phase**.  
Weâ€™re pushing the limits to make sure this isnâ€™t just another plugin â€” but **the fastest one** in the Solana ecosystem.  
We really, really donâ€™t want to mess this up.

Thereâ€™s even a chance weâ€™ll need to swap out **SpacetimeDB** if it doesn't hold up under pressure (we hope not â€” but speed comes first).

**Stay tuned.**
